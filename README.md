R-Diet
======

A small tool I wrote in R to record my weight loss progress.

This program tracks three data frames. One for a user's weight, one for the food a user eats and one for the exercise a user does.

For now, it only calculates in imperial units. I might add some more stuff to this later.

Instructions
======
Run the init script, then make whatever calls you want from the R console to store data.

Warning
======
The init script starts by clearing all workspace variables, so you should run this program in it's own data frame.
